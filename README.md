# 🎯 Pentesting Journey: IAM Engineer → Penetration Tester

## 👋 About Me

I'm Shiva Karthik, an IAM and Active Directory professional with 2+ years of 
enterprise experience managing 500+ users. I'm transitioning into offensive 
security and documenting my 30-day intensive learning journey.

## 🔥 Why This Transition?

For 2+ years, I've been building and managing security controls:
- Active Directory administration
- Privileged Access Management
- Identity Lifecycle Management
- MFA implementation
- Access governance

Now I'm learning to **test** if these controls actually work by thinking like 
an attacker.
